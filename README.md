# XyloxNews
### A simple API with realtime SignalR endpoints.

##Project AIM

The AIM/Goal of this project is to create a small external service for the project Xylox which would allow me to publish update notes, general news & upcoming feature notes. The end point is being able to consume this API across any Xylox related UI's such as Discord, Web & anything else.
